# Forest Fire Risk Zone Mapping using Logistic Regression model in R - A Case study of Kandhamal District, Odisha​

As per the multiple forest fire events occurred in Odisha, Kandhamal was one of the major affected district in 2015. In this project, a small attempt has done to predict fire risk zones considering specific features to avoid serious consequences ahead due to fire.

## Introduction

Forests constitute the largest, complex & most important natural resource mostly dominated by trees or continuous forest with trees usually growing to more than about seven meters in height & able to produce wood.​
Forest fire may be defined as “an unclosed and freely spreading combustion  that  consumes  the  natural  fuels”.​
When a fire burns out of control it is known as Wild Fire​

## Objectives:

- Report the major fire-causing factors in the study area and to predict the chance of occurrences of fire.
- Investigate the natural and anthropogenic key factors that may affect the fire risk in Kandhmal region.
- Determining fire risk area using multiple parameters.
